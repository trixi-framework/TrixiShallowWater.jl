It is applied to all scalar variables in their given order using the defined threshold_limiter from the equations struct  (e.g. in ShallowWaterEquations1D) to determine the minimal acceptable values. The order of the variables is important and might have a strong influence on the robustness. The limiter is available for the ShallowWaterEquations1D, ShallowWaterEquations2D, and ShallowWaterMultiLayerEquations1D.\n\nAs opposed to the standard version of the Trixi.PositivityPreservingLimiterZhangShu, nodes with a water height below the threshold_limiter are treated in a special way. To avoid numerical problems caused by velocities close to zero, the velocity is cut off, such that the node can be identified as \"dry\". The special feature of the ShallowWaterEquations used here is that the bottom topography is stored as an additional quantity in the solution vector u. However, the value of the bottom topography should not be changed. That is why, it is not limited.\n\nAfter the limiting process is applied to all degrees of freedom, for safety reasons, the threshold_limiter is applied again on all the DG nodes in order to avoid water height below. In the case where the cell mean value is below the threshold before applying the limiter, there could still be dry nodes afterwards due to the logic of the limiter. Additionally, a velocity  desingularization is applied after the limiting to avoid numerical problems near dry states.
