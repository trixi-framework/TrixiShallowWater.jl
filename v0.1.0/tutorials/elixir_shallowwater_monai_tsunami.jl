# # Okushiri Tsunami

# In this tutorial, we will use the shallow water equations with wetting and drying
# on an unstructured quadrilateral mesh to numerically approximate the Okushiri tsunami experiment
# that models the wave runup near the village of Monai on Okushiri Island.
# This benchmark problem comes from a 1/400 scale laboratory experiment that used a wave tank
# at the Central Research Institute for Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI) in Abiko, Japan.
#
# This is an application that exercises the ability of TrixiShallowWater.jl to model
# tsunami runup onto a complex three-dimensional coastline.
# The bathymetry data for this test case is approximated with bicubic splines.
# A thorough description of this problem setup and the original data files are
# available [here](https://isec.nacse.org/workshop/2004_cornell/bmark2.html).

# The tutorial will cover:
# - Create an unstructured quadrilateral mesh with [HOHQMesh.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/HOHQMesh.jl)
# - Set up a SWE solver for wet/dry transitions
# - Approximate bathymetry data with [TrixiBottomTopography.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/TrixiBottomTopography.jl)
# - Create custom initial conditions, boundary conditions, and source terms
# - Postprocess solution data with [Trixi2Vtk.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi2Vtk.jl)
# - Visualization with [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/download/)

# ## Load required packages
# The core solver component is TrixiShallowWater.jl,
# which requires [`Trixi.jl`](@extref Trixi.jl) for the underlying spatial discretization
# and `OrdinaryDiffEqSSPRK.jl` for time integration.
# `HOHQMesh.jl` is needed to generate an unstructured mesh for this problem.
# `TrixiBottomTopography.jl` is needed to create a bathymetry approximation that is directly
# usable by Trixi.jl.
# Finally, we include [`CairoMakie.jl`](https://docs.makie.org/stable/) for insitu visualization and `Trixi2Vtk.jl` for postprocessing.

# ## Visualize the original bathymetry
# First, we obtain and plot the raw bathymetry data. An examination of the bathymetry
# and its features will aid in designing an appropriate mesh for the discretization.
# We download the raw bathymetry data to make it available locally
raw_bathymetry_file = Trixi.download("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/andrewwinters5000/305d203c0409d26075aa2993ff367637/raw/df480a6ff63da1916a19820b060abfea83d40dbf/raw_monai_bathymetry.txt",
                                     joinpath(@__DIR__, "raw_monai_bathymetry.txt"));

# Next, we open and parse the bathymetry data to visualize it
file = open(raw_bathymetry_file)
lines = readlines(file)

# From the bathymetry visualization we can identify that there are several regions
# of interest that require higher resolution to create an accurate approximation.
# In particular, there is a island located near the center of the domain and a cliff side
# that dominates the right portion of the domain.

# This information is useful to guide the creation of an unstructured quadrilateral mesh.
# In HOHQMesh, we set a background grid and then specify targeted refinement regions to add
# more elements where more resolution is required to resolve the bathymetry.

# ## Create an unstructured mesh
# To begin, we create a new mesh project.
# The output files created by HOHQMesh will be saved into the "out" folder
# and carry the same name as the project, in this case "monai_shore".
monai = newProject("monai_shore", "out");

# Next, we set the polynomial order for the boundaries to be linear, i.e., polynomials of degree one.
# The file format is set to ["ISM-V2"](https://trixi-framework.github.io/HOHQMesh/TheISMMeshFileFormats/#ism)
# as it is compatible with `UnstructuredMesh2D` mesh type
# that will be used later in the solver.
setPolynomialOrder!(monai, 1)
setMeshFileFormat!(monai, "ISM-V2");

# The rectangular domain for this problem has no interior or exterior boundary curves.
# To suppress extraneous output from HOHQMesh during the mesh generation process we create
# an empty MODEL dictionary.
HOHQMesh.getModelDict(monai);

# Now we can set a background Cartesian box mesh required to define
# the length scales in the mesh generation process.
# The domain for this problem setup is $[0.0, 5.488] \times [0.0, 3.402]$.
# To initialize the mesh, the domain boundary edges are provided in `bounds`
# with order `[top, left, bottom, right]`.
# The background grid is coarse with eight elements in the $x$-direction
# and four elements in the $y$-direction.
bounds = [3.402, 0.0, 0.0, 5.488]
N = [8, 4, 0]
addBackgroundGrid!(monai, bounds, N)

# From the inspection of the bathymetry visualization above we indicate regions
# in the domain to target additional refinement during mesh generation.
# One [`RefinementCenter`](https://trixi-framework.github.io/HOHQMesh.jl/stable/reference/#HOHQMesh.newRefinementCenter-Tuple{String,%20String,%20Array{Float64},%20Float64,%20Float64})
# is placed around the island near the center of the domain.
# Three [`RefinementLine`](https://trixi-framework.github.io/HOHQMesh.jl/stable/reference/#HOHQMesh.newRefinementLine-Tuple{String,%20String,%20Array{Float64},%20Array{Float64},%20Float64,%20Float64})
# areas are placed in the wake region of said island and the coastline.
island = newRefinementCenter("island", "smooth", [3.36, 1.68, 0.0], 0.1, 0.15)
wake = newRefinementLine("wake", "smooth", [3.75, 1.7, 0.0],
                         [4.75, 1.7, 0.0], 0.15, 0.2)
shoreline_top = newRefinementLine("shoreline", "smooth", [4.816, 3.374, 0.0],
                                  [4.83, 2.366, 0.0], 0.15, 0.168)

                                     [5.32, 1.4, 0.0], 0.075, 0.22);

# These four refinement regions are then added into the `monai` mesh project.
add!(monai, island)
add!(monai, wake)
add!(monai, shoreline_top)
add!(monai, shoreline_bottom)

# One can plot the current project to inspect the background grid and refinement region locations using

# ![mesh_before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9666e5da-c8d6-42e5-be38-0c54f3e15d6c)

# The locations of the refinement regions look good so that we can generate the mesh.
# The call to `generate_mesh` prints mesh also prints quality statistics and updates the visualization.
generate_mesh(monai);

# ![mesh_after](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6157a39c-e8ff-443a-b4d3-e0061188bea6)

# Additionally, this will output the following files to the `out` folder:
# - `monai_shore.control`: A HOHQMesh control file for the current project.
# - `monai_shore.tec`: A TecPlot formatted file to visualize the mesh with other software, e.g., ParaView.
# - `monai_shore.mesh`: A mesh file with format "ISM-V2".

# ## Discretize the problem setup
# With the mesh in hand we can proceed to construct the solver components and callbacks
# for the tsunami runup problem.

# For this example we solve the two-dimensional shallow water equations,
# so we use the [`ShallowWaterEquationsWetDry2D`](@ref ShallowWaterEquationsWetDry2D)
# and specify the gravitational acceleration to `gravity = 9.812`
# as well as a background water height `H0 = 0.0`.
# In contrast to the [`Trixi.ShallowWaterEquations2D`](@extref Trixi.ShallowWaterEquations2D) type,
# this equation type allows contains additional parameters and methods needed to handle wetting and drying.
equations = ShallowWaterEquationsWetDry2D(gravity = 9.81, H0 = 0.0)

# Next, we construct an approximation to the bathymetry with TrixiBottomTopography.jl using
# a [`BicubicBSpline`](https://trixi-framework.github.io/TrixiBottomTopography.jl/stable/reference/#TrixiBottomTopography.BicubicBSpline)
# with the "not-a-knot" boundary closure.
# For this we first download the bathymetry data that has been preprocessed to be in the format
# required by TrixiBottomTopography, see [here](https://trixi-framework.github.io/TrixiBottomTopography.jl/stable/conversion/#Data-format-of-TrixiBottomTopography.jl) for more information.

# ## Run the simulation
# Finally, we solve the ODE problem using a strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) method.
# The [PositivityPreservingLimiterShallowWater](https://github.com/trixi-framework/TrixiShallowWater.jl/pull/index.html#TrixiShallowWater.PositivityPreservingLimiterShallowWater)
# is used as a stage limiter to ensure positivity
# of the water height during the simulation. The [SSPRK43](https://docs.sciml.ai/OrdinaryDiffEq/stable/explicit/SSPRK/#OrdinaryDiffEqSSPRK.SSPRK43)
# integrator supports adaptive timestepping;
# however, this is deactivated with `adaptive=false` as we use a CFL-based time step restriction.
# ```julia
# stage_limiter! = PositivityPreservingLimiterShallowWater(variables = (waterheight,))
# sol = solve(ode, SSPRK43(stage_limiter!); dt = 1.0,
#           ode_default_options()..., callback = callbacks, adaptive = false);
# ```

# ## Postprocessing the solution data
# It is useful to visualize and inspect the solution and bathymetry of the shallow water equations.
# One option available is post-processing the Trixi.jl output file(s)
# with the Trixi2Vtk.jl functionality and plotting them with ParaView.

# To convert all the HDF5-formatted `.h5` output file(s) from TrixiShallowWater.jl
# into VTK format execute the following
# ```julia
# trixi2vtk("out/solution_*.h5", output_directory = "out")
# ```
# then it is possible to open the `.pvd` file with ParaView and create a video of the simulation.
# In addition, the `trixi2vtk` call will create `celldata` files if one wishes to plot
# the shock capturing parameter.

# In ParaView, after opening the appropriate solution `.pvd` file, one can apply two instances
# of the `Warp By Scalar` filter to visualize the water height and bathymetry in three dimensions.
# Many additional customizations, e.g., color scaling, fonts, etc. are available in ParaView.
# An example of the output at the final time $22.5$ is given below.

# ![paraview_example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc676f3a-4673-4fd7-9385-a9b0415598af)

# ## Putting it all together
# Now the problem discretization components are assembled and working
# together with a postprocessing pipeline.
# We run the simulation, which takes approximately 12 minutes with solution files
# in the `SaveSolutionCallback`
# written every `dt = 0.04` to obtain a high temporal resolution of the solution output.
# We then visualize the solution, bathymetry, and shock capturing using ParaView and create
# a video of the [tsunami runup simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osyx48Qn10U).
