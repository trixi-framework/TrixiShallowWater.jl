# In this tutorial, we will use the shallow water equations with wetting and drying
# on an unstructured quadrilateral mesh to model the Okushiri tsunami experiment.
# This is an application that exercises the ability of TrixiShallowWater.jl to model
# tsunami runup onto a complex 3D beach.
# The bathymetry data for this test case is approximated with bicubic splines.
# A thorough description of this problem setup and the original data files are
# available [here](https://isec.nacse.org/workshop/2004_cornell/bmark2.html).

# The tutorial will cover:
# - Create an unstructured quadrilateral mesh with [HOHQMesh.jl](@extref HOHQMesh.jl)
# - Set up a SWE solver for wet/dry transitions

# Before we begin, we load the required packages. The core solver component is TrixiShallowWater.jl,

# and `OrdinaryDiffEqSSPRK.jl` for time integration.
# HOHQMesh.jl is needed to generate an unstructured mesh for this problem.
# TrixiBottomTopography.jl is needed to create a bathymetry approximation that is directly
# usable by Trixi.jl.
# Finally, we include `CairoMakie.jl` for insitu visualization.
