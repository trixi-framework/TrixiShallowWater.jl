# # Dam break over triangular bottom topography
# In this tutorial we will use the shallow water equations to simulate a dam break over triangular 
# bottom topography with wetting and drying and compare the results to experimental data. The test
# case is based on a dam break experiment and has been discussed in:

# The tutorial will cover:
# - Set up a SWE solver for wet/dry transitions
# - Create custom initial conditions and source terms
# - Save solution data at gauge points
# - Visualization with [`Makie.jl`](https://docs.makie.org/dev/)

# ## Load required packages
# Before we start, we need to load the required packages. Besides TrixiShallowWater.jl, we require
# [`Trixi.jl`](@extref Trixi.jl) for the spatial discretization and [`OrdinaryDiffEqSSPRK.jl`](https://docs.sciml.ai/OrdinaryDiffEq/stable/) for time integration.
# In addition to that [`CairoMakie.jl`](https://docs.makie.org/dev/) is used for visualization and [`CSV.jl`](https://csv.juliadata.org/stable/) and [`DataFrames.jl`](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/) will
# be used to load the experimental data.

# Standard packages
using OrdinaryDiffEqSSPRK
using Trixi
using TrixiShallowWater
# Packages for visualization
using CairoMakie
using DataFrames
using CSV

# ## Prepare and run the problem setup

# In the first step we will set up the equation system. In this example we want to solve the
# one-dimensional shallow water equations, so we will use the [`ShallowWaterEquationsWetDry1D`](@ref ShallowWaterEquationsWetDry1D)
# and specify the gravitational acceleration to `gravity = 9.812`. In contrast to the
# [`Trixi.ShallowWaterEquations1D`](@extref Trixi.ShallowWaterEquations1D) type, this equation type
# contains additional parameters and methods that are needed to handle wetting and drying.
equations = ShallowWaterEquationsWetDry1D(gravity = 9.812)

# We then create a function to supply the initial condition for the simulation. Note, in the last
# step of this function the water height needs to be shifted by a small value to avoid division by zero.
function initial_condition_dam_break_triangular(x, t,
                                                equations::ShallowWaterEquationsWetDry1D)
    b = 0.0  # Bottom topography
    h = 0.0  # Water height
    v = 0.0  # Velocity

    if x[1] <= 15.5
        h = 0.75  # Water height in the left reservoir
    elseif 25.5 < x[1] && x[1] <= 28.5
        b = (x[1] - 25.5) * 0.4 / 3.0  # Rising slope of the triangular bottom
    elseif x[1] > 28.5 && x[1] < 31.5
        b = 0.4 - (x[1] - 28.5) * 0.4 / 3.0  # Falling slope of the triangular bottom
    end

    H = h + b  # Total water height
    if x[1] > 28.5
        H = max(H, 0.15)  # Water height in the right reservoir
    end

    ## It is mandatory to shift the water level at dry areas to make sure the water height h
    ## stays positive. The system would not be stable for h set to a hard zero due to division by h in
    ## the computation of velocity, e.g., (h v) / h. Therefore, a small dry state threshold
    ## with a default value of 5*eps() â‰ˆ 1e-13 in double precision, is set in the constructor above
    ## for the ShallowWaterEquations and added to the initial condition if h = 0.
    ## This default value can be changed within the constructor call depending on the simulation setup.
    H = max(H, b + equations.threshold_limiter)
    return prim2cons(SVector(H, v, b), equations)

# As we want to compare the results to experimental data, we also need to account for bottom friction.
# For this we create a new source term, which adds a Manning friction term to the momentum equation.

    h, hv, _ = u

    n = 0.0125  # friction coefficient
    h = (h^2 + max(h^2, 1e-8)) / (2 * h) # desingularization procedure

# Now we can set up the DG approximation space. We use the discontinuous Galerkin spectral element
# method ([`DGSEM`](@extref Trixi.DGSEM)), with a volume integral in flux differencing formulation.

# contains nonconservative terms the fluxes are provided in form of a tuple
# `flux = (conservative flux, nonconservative_flux)`. To ensure well-balancedness and positivity a
# reconstruction procedure is applied for the surface fluxes and a shock-capturing scheme with modified
# indicator function is used to compute the volume integrals.

# The semi-discretization object combines the mesh, equations, initial condition,

# Callbacks are used to monitor the simulation, save results, and control the time step.
# Below, we define several callbacks for different purposes.

# ### AnalysisCallback
# The [`AnalysisCallback`](@extref Trixi.AnalysisCallback) is used to analyze the solution at regular
# intervals. Extra analysis quantities such as conservation errors can be added to the callback.

# The [`TimeSeriesCallback`](@extref Trixi.TimeSeriesCallback) is used to extract time series
# data at a specific gauge location.

# ### Stepsize Callback

# Finally, we can go ahead an solve the ODE problem using a strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta 
# (SSPRK) method. The [`PositivityPreservingLimiterShallowWater`](@ref PositivityPreservingLimiterShallowWater) is used as a stage limiter to ensure 
# positivity of the water height during the simulation. The [`SSPRK43`](https://docs.sciml.ai/OrdinaryDiffEq/stable/explicit/SSPRK/#OrdinaryDiffEqSSPRK.SSPRK43) integrator supports adaptive 
# timestepping, but since we use a CFL-based time step we set (`adaptive = false`). For visualization

# ## Visualization
# After solving the ODE problem, we want to visualize the results. The first plot shows the water height
# over the spatial domain at different times. The second plot compares the simulation results
# to experimental data at a gauge point **G4** located at $x=19.5\,\text{m}$.
