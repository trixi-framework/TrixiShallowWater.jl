# Refine elements in the DG solver based on a list of cell_ids that should be refined.
# On `P4estMesh`, if an element refines the solution scaled by the Jacobian `J*u` is interpolated
# from the parent element into the four children elements. The solution on each child
# element is then recovered by dividing by the new element Jacobians.
# After refinement, projections may introduce inadmissible solution states like negative
# water heights. So the limiter is called to remedy this.
#
# TODO: Requires modification for use with `TreeMesh` because the Jacobian is constant.
# A generic version is available in Trixi.jl in `src/callbacks_step/amr_dg2d.jl`.
# However, the well-balanced mortar implementation would need added to `TreeMesh` first.
