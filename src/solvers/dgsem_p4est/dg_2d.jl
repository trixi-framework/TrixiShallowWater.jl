# TODO: Once working the mortar methods could likely be extended to the other
# equation types available in the package. Although for the multilayer equations
# care must be taken because the pressure term is separated from the physical flux
# and directly placed in the nonconservative flux

# The methods below are specialized on the `P4estShallowWaterMortarContainer`
# mortar type. Extra storage is necessary for the numerical flux plus nonconservative term
# on either side of the parent (large) element mortars. It also requires a work
# array to compute the flux with the projected large element solutions on each mortar
# to ensure we project back the flux penalty.
